# Solana Ed25519 signature verification - native Rust

Example of Ed25519 signature verification.

The initial codebase was retaken from https://github.com/GuidoDipietro/solana-ed25519-secp256k1-sig-verification; 

However, an example from the repository mentioned before is using Rust Anchor Framework; therefore, using this example, you can see how to use (i.e., on-chain signature verification) it also within Native Rust Solana Smart Contractors.
